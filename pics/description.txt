These are a few pictures I took of my makeshift weather camera.  The blue electrical box is available at Home Depot.  I painted the South side white to try and limit heat rise since it is close to the WS-1400 temperature sensor.  The plastic blue box opening for the phone protrusion was made via a drill bit.  It is very soft plastic.  I eventually used tin snips to cut a bucket lid and mount it above the phone/camera.  The lens still gets wet on high wind/rain events.  People are dumping their cracked screen phones on ebay for not much money.  Retasking them for outdoor camera use takes a fair amount of time/labor.  Once you get them mounted / initially programmed you can remote control them via screen controllers like Vysor (not for Samsung), Mobizen (yes on Samsung), or others.
